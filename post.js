You can also program your pump to alert you when your CGM readings are above or below a given level, or are rising or falling quickly. Unlike the readings from a standard blood glucose meter, CGM readings allow you to view trends in real time, as well as capture information when you would otherwise be unable to check your blood sugar, such as while you are asleep. This information can be useful for you and your healthcare provider when considering changes to your therapy. In addition, the programmable alerts can help you to spot potential low or high BG sooner than you would using a only a blood glucose meter.",
