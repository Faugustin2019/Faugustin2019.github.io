</div><div class="sfContentBlock"><h3 id="legal">&nbsp;<br>

<p>Licensor processes Licensee’s personal data when Licensor has Licensee’s consent to do so; and when the processing is necessary for Licensor’s legitimate business interests.

<h4><strong>Data Sharing</strong></h4>
<p>Licensor does not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose Licensee’s Personal Data with any entity except for the applicable Distributor.</p>
<h4><strong>Data Protection</strong></h4>
<p>Licensor protects your personal data using administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that are designed to maintain the data’s confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
